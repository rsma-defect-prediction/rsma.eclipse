# Eclipse datasets for rsma

## Description
This package contains 8 datasets for software defect prediction: 
- eclipse_bug 
- eclipse_change 
- eclipse_churn 
- eclipse_ckoo 
- eclipse_complexity 
- eclipse_entropy 
- eclipse_file 
- eclipse_package 

## Details
The software metrics in these datasets have been computed from 5 Java projects:

- Eclipse JDT Core: IDE for software developers.

- Equinox framework: for developing modular software programs and libraries. Connected to Eclipse main project.

- Apache Lucene: library providing indexing and search features.

- Mylyn: provides task management tools.

- Eclipse PDE UI: plug-in development environment to develop Eclipse features.
